			<h1>Crust</h1>
			<p>The crust ranges from 5–70 kilometres in depth and is the outermost layer. The thin parts are the oceanic crust, which underlie the ocean basins (5–10 km) and are composed of dense (mafic) iron magnesium silicate igneous rocks, like basalt. The thicker crust is continental crust, which is less dense and composed of (felsic) sodium potassium aluminium silicate rocks, like granite. The uppermost mantle together with the crust constitutes the lithosphere. The crust-mantle boundary occurs as two physically different events. Many rocks now making up Earth's crust formed less than 100 million years ago; however, the oldest known mineral grains are about 4.4 billion years old, indicating that Earth has had a solid crust for at least 4.4 billion years.</p>

		<div id="--mantle" class="section">
			<h1>Mantle</h1>
			<p>Earth's mantle extends to a depth of 2,890 km, making it the thickest layer of Earth. The mantle is usually divided into upper and lower mantle. The upper and lower mantle are separated by the transition zone. The mantle is composed of silicate rocks that are rich in iron and magnesium relative to the overlying crust. Although solid, the high temperatures within the mantle cause the silicate material to be sufficiently ductile that it can flow on very long timescales. Convection of the mantle is expressed at the surface through the motions of tectonic plates. As there is intense and increasing pressure as one travels deeper into the mantle, the lower part of the mantle flows less easily than does the upper mantle. The source of heat that drives plate tectonics is the primordial heat left over from the planet’s formation as well as the radioactive decay of uranium, thorium, and potassium in Earth’s crust and mantle.</p>

			<h1>Outer Core</h1>
			<p>The outer core of the Earth is a fluid layer about 2,400 km thick and composed of mostly iron and nickel that lies above Earth's solid inner core and below its mantle. Its outer boundary lies 2,890 km beneath Earth's surface. The transition between the inner core and outer core is located approximately 5,150 km beneath the Earth's surface. Unlike the inner core, the outer core is liquid. The inner core is also referred to as the solid core.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="--core-inner" class="section">
			<h1>Inner Core</h1>
			<p>The Earth's inner core is the Earth's innermost part. It is primarily a solid ball with a radius of about 1,220 kilometres, which is about 70% of the Moon's radius. It is composed of an iron–nickel alloy and some other elements. The temperature at the inner core's surface is approximately 5,700 K (5,430 °C), which is about the temperature at the surface of the Sun.</p>
